"""Wall-clock lever model — the cascade of physical bounds that decides whether
a finding actually shortens a developer's wait.

A finding's raw wall-clock estimate is squeezed down through a series of
physical bounds toward the true developer-wait it removes:

    raw per-pattern estimate
      → CAP 1  within-workflow critical path   (_cap_wall_clock)
      → CAP 2  cross-workflow concurrency floor (_cap_wall_clock_cross_workflow)
      → effective Δ wall-clock

The mental model: developer wall-clock wait = max over all workflows triggered
on the PR of (that workflow's critical path). A finding is a real wall-clock
lever ⟺ it shortens the long pole of the GATING workflow, and only down to the
next floor.

This module is a LEAF — it depends only on the stdlib (no `collect_runs`, no
`config`), so the bounds are unit-testable in isolation (`import wall_clock`).
`collect_runs` owns the data sampling and the `_critical_path` aggregation that
PRODUCES the `crit` dict these bounds consume; the bounds here only reason over
already-measured inputs (a crit dict, a concurrency list, a raw estimate).

Step 1 of the extraction moved the existing bound functions here verbatim.
Step 2 wraps them in a uniform `Bound` contract behind `size_wall_clock()` with
monotonic-down + no-silent-shrink invariants; Step 3 adds further bounds.

# The hygiene caps above shrink a per-step saving DOWN to the headroom above the
# cluster floor — correct for a fix that shortens ONE job, because the next job
# then gates the run. Two STRUCTURAL levers are different and need their own
# (still floor-honest) math:
#
#   - De-triggering a non-required pole REMOVES that check from the parallel set
#     entirely, so the developer's wait drops to the next-slowest concurrent
#     check — the whole check's time above that floor, not a per-step slice.
#   - A shared sub-step that recurs across MULTIPLE cluster jobs is the one lever
#     that BEATS the floor: cutting it lowers every cluster job at once, so the
#     long pole AND the floor both drop by the step's per-job cost. The
#     wall-clock saving is the per-job step time itself (the long pole stays the
#     long pole, now shorter), not capped at the old long_pole−floor headroom.
#     The runner-minute saving is the per-job cost times the number of jobs.
#
# Both still pass through `size_wall_clock` afterward so the CROSS-workflow
# measured-critical-path floor (other concurrent checks gating the same PR) is
# enforced — these helpers only set the RAW estimate the cascade then bounds.

    restore), `cluster_job_count` how many critical-path jobs run the step.

    Wall-clock saving = the addressable per-job step time (step − warm floor):
    because the step recurs across the whole cluster, cutting it lowers every
    cluster job together, so the long pole stays the long pole but shorter — the

    Runner-minute saving = that per-job time × the number of jobs (every copy
    gets cheaper). Both are RAW; the cross-workflow cascade still floors the

    The runner-minute figure applies the cluster's cheapest-member per-job step
    time (the caller's `min(material.values())` conservative shared floor) to EVERY
    leg's volume. Because it is a MODELED step-p50 × monthly-volume figure while the

    counted run actually ran the step), it can still exceed the affected legs' Σ
    measured billable — the basis mismatch, not a slowest-member over-attribution
    (issue #52 re-check). That over-credit is bounded downstream by the measured
    sizing door: OPT73 is a CLAMP pattern, so `_reground_runner_minute_savings`
    clamps this saving to the affected legs' Σ measured billable
    (`_measured_billable_for_jobs`, now joined by EXACT job identity). Bounding it
