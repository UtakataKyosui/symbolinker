"""Tests for scripts/summary.py — the agent-facing data-pass digest + render command.

The summary exists so the orchestrator acts on ONE structured block instead of
hand-spelunking findings.json, re-probing gh for gating, or reading blocking_path.py
source to reconstruct the render invocation. These lock the three guarantees:
the gating "don't re-probe" note, the fileless auto-demote flag, matrix-collapsed
poles, and — critically — that every emitted render KEY binds back to its own pole
via blocking_path._match_key (the actual matcher the renderer uses)."""
