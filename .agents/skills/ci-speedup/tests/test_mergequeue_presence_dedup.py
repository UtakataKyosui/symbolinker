"""Issue #58 — merge-queue runs must not inflate the presence denominator.

A `merge_group` (merge-queue) run executes on a GitHub-generated temporary branch
`gh-readonly-queue/<base>/pr-<N>-<sha>`, i.e. a DISTINCT head_sha per PR. Keying the
per-PR presence population by raw head_sha therefore counts each queue run as a
separate "PR" in the denominator. On a repo that runs its heavy suite only in the
merge queue (heavy suite on `merge_group`, light checks on `pull_request`), the heavy
suite then reads as present on a MINORITY of the sampled "PRs", and the
presence-weighted machinery (#26/#27/#57 — `_workflow_gates_minority`) demotes the
REAL merge gate to a runner-minute-only "minority slow mode", crowning a lighter check.

The fix (`_group_dev_shas_by_pr`) collapses the population denominator to PR IDENTITY
BEFORE sampling: a queue run is folded onto its PR's row (via the queue branch's PR
number) so the heavy suite is present on that PR; unlinkable queue runs collapse onto a
single class that cannot dilute PR presence. Every downstream presence / populations /
chain_facts consumer re-derives from the deduped `per_sha_checks`, so no verifier mirror
moves.

These tests pin:
  * the queue-branch PR-number parser and the per-run PR-number derivation;
  * the grouping rule (fold queued PR runs + queue runs onto one row, single-class
    orphans, and — the no-regression guarantee — an IDENTITY map when no `merge_group`
    run is present);
  * the RED-PROOF: a merge-queue-shaped sample demotes the heavy gate BEFORE dedup
    (`_workflow_gates_minority` fires on the inflated 2N denominator) and keeps it AFTER
    (N denominator), with `_rank_spine_present_first` crowning the heavy check post-dedup.
