"""Regression tests for issue #66 — a sample straddling a workflow-config change must NEVER
blend the two CI configurations (a stale headline, a fabricated cross-era drill, a recoverable
ceiling above the typical wait).

The class (internal-dev-repo re-audit, the second-run journey audit -> fix -> re-audit): the
collector sampled PRs from BOTH sides of the `ci.yml` change, drilled a PRE-change run for `test`
(the full guard step) and a POST-change run for `guard shard 3/4` (the quarter slice), and
synthesized a FABRICATED "guard runs twice, once whole and once sharded" redundancy that no PR ever
ran. The headline also strained: a `2m46s` typical wait (post-fix population) beside `~6m28s
recoverable` (pre-fix drill) — a ceiling >2x the wait it recovers.

Two fixes, one PR:
  1. **Config-era boundary in the collector** (`collect_runs._workflow_change_boundary` +
     `_partition_config_era`): detect each workflow file's last-change commit; partition its sampled
     runs at that boundary; keep the POST-change era when it is sufficient (narrowed window) else the
     PRE-change era WITH a prominent disclosure. Either way ONE era survives per workflow, so a drill
     can't blend eras. Stamped in `pr_critical_path.config_eras`; `blocking_path` renders the
     disclosure; `verify_report.check_config_era_boundary` re-derives the bind.
  2. **Recoverable-within-wait coherence** (`blocking_path._recoverable_reconciliation`): a rendered
     recoverable ceiling above the typical wait co-renders the slow-mode/worst-case reconciliation;
     `verify_report.check_recoverable_within_wait` is the bounds-family guard.

# sampled PRs were BOTH post-change, so #72's disclosed_pre run-count cut would empty the enumeration.
# The old skip-whole fallback left the blend intact AND cleared the stamps the enum guard re-derives
# from, so `test` @ 8m58s + `guard shard 3/4` rendered as poles under a "reflect the configuration
# BEFORE it" disclosure — a report whose disclosure lied about its own contents.

# Fix: the flip makes the state space TOTAL. Every straddle resolves to exactly one of
