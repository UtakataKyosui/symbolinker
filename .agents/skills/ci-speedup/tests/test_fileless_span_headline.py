"""Regression tests for issue #12 — a fileless/managed status check's PR-lifetime span must
NEVER crown the merge-wait headline; it is DISCLOSED as PR-lifetime status-gating latency instead.

The class (electron/electron, round-3): the headline merge-wait read ~8 days (11659m), crowned by
`Backport Labels Added` / `faraday/cage` — fileless app/label status checks whose check-run span
(`_duration_s(started_at, completed_at)`) measures PR-LIFETIME human/bot label-gating latency, not
CI wall-clock. `_pole_caps` builds de-inflation caps only from sampled jobs, so a check with NO
sampled job is never capped and its raw span flows into `critical_path_s` /
`chain_summary.makespan_p50_s` and crowns the headline over file-backed poles tracing <1% of it.

The fix (`collect_runs._partition_fileless_checks`): exclude non-job-groundable checks from the
crowning basis at the data layer, stamp them in `fileless_status_checks`, and DISCLOSE the slowest
one in the report. `blocking_path` renders the disclosure; `verify_report`'s
`check_headline_basis_excludes_fileless` re-derives the disjointness + disclosure bind.
