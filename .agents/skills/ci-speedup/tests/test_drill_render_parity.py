"""Regression: the drill-bundle CAPTURE pole set must equal the report's RENDERED
pole set, so every rendered long pole has its OWN captured log.

Bug (lancedb/lancedb): Long pole 2 (`python.yml ▸ Doctest`) rendered the pydantic1x
job's evidence — run/job id, step timeline, and cross-run magnitudes all belonged to a
DIFFERENT job. Root cause: the capture-time drill selection sorted the non-gate matrices
by IMPACT only (`max(median, bimodal slow mode)`), which pulled the rare-but-slow
`build - aarch64-apple-darwin` leg (present on a MINORITY of PRs, but long when it runs)
above the TYPICAL `Doctest` pole. So capture drilled `build` while the renderer demoted
it (typical-first tiering) and rendered `Doctest`. `Doctest` then had no captured log,
and `blocking_path._match_key`'s exact-workflow-stem rule (`python`) bound its drill to
the sibling pydantic1x bundle — the wrong job's evidence.

The fix makes `collect_runs._order_drill_matrices` tier typical-first then rare (by
impact), EXACTLY as `blocking_path.render` orders the poles it renders, so the captured
set equals the rendered set.
