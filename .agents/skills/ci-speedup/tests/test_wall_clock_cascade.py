"""The wall-clock bound cascade (wall_clock.size_wall_clock).

`wall_clock` is a stdlib-only leaf module, so — unlike `report` — it imports
cleanly under pytest without the config/report module-name collision. These
tests pin the cascade's two invariants (monotonic-down, no-silent-shrink), the
derivation chain, and the two shipped bounds (within-workflow floor, cross-
workflow concurrency floor).

Run from the repo root:
