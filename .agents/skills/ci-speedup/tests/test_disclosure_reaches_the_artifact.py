"""INTEGRATION tests for the coverage disclosure: data -> renderer -> verifier.

Why this file exists, in one sentence: a green helper-level suite proved NOTHING
about the artifact.

The bug that motivated it. `collect()` builds `data_sources.partial_reason` through
`_partial_reason(...)`, which NAMES every workflow whose run-list fetch failed — a
workflow that vanished from the sample, so the critical path was recomputed from the
SURVIVORS. Two hundred lines later, an unconditional re-stamp at the end of the SAME
function overwrote it with a bare count:

    "1 gh API call(s) failed during collection"

which reads as a rounding error. The rate-limited merge gate was gone from the audit,
the report headlined a confident WRONG gate off whatever else survived, and every
existing guard passed — including the unit test of `_partial_reason` itself, which
tested a function whose output the shipped pipeline never used.

So these tests drive the REAL `collect()` and the REAL renderer, and assert on the
REPORT TEXT a user would read:

  1. `collect()` with a failing run list           -> partial_reason NAMES the workflow
  2. `collect()` + render                          -> the REPORT NAMES the workflow
  3. `collect()` with a failing workflow list      -> aborts, and the report does not
                                                      read as a normal (quiet-repo) audit
  4. EVERY run list fails                          -> the report must NOT say "an
                                                      archived, brand-new, or
                                                      low-activity repo"
  5. every JOB fetch for a workflow fails          -> named, and barred from headlining
                                                      off a queue-inflated check-run span
  6. `verify_report`'s invariant                   -> a report that hides a gap FAILS
  7. a permanently broken API (rate limit / 5xx /
     timeout) and a malformed body                 -> terminate, with a disclosed gap

Round 3 had to re-learn the lesson at this file's own expense: five of its
"integration" tests called `blocking_path._coverage_note` DIRECTLY with hand-built
dicts and never rendered a report — the exact anti-pattern the paragraphs above
indict. They passed while the RENDERER, 2000 lines away, went on printing "an
archived, brand-new, or low-activity repo" over a total run-list wipeout. They are
artifact-level now.

Rules for anything added here:
  - drive `collect()` and/or the real `render()`, and assert on the RENDERED REPORT;
  - never assert on a helper the shipped artifact does not call;
  - no tautologies (an `... or True` assertion was live in this file for a round).
