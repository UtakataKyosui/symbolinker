"""Run-cited evidence for data-driven findings.

A timing finding (shard imbalance, long test job, step outlier, …) is proven by
run TIMINGS, not by a workflow file:line. These tests pin that the detectors
emit structured `measured_evidence` whose table cells link to the ACTUAL GitHub
job logs, and that the report renders that table (not a meaningless code
permalink + YAML block).

The render check runs report.py as a SUBPROCESS (mirroring real invocation),
which also sidesteps the `config` module-name collision on the shared pytest
pythonpath.
