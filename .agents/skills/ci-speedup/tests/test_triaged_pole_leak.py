"""Regression: a triaged-fast workflow must never leak into the critical-path poles.

A workflow whose slowest sampled run finishes under `_TRIAGE_WALLCLOCK_FLOOR_S` is
TRIAGED — its per-run job fetch is skipped and it is disclosed in
`data_sources.triaged_fast_workflows` as "can't hold the merge pole". But its check-run
still rides along on the sampled PRs, so its check-run p50 lands in `pr_checks_tuple` and
could rank into the structural top-N. Because its jobs were never fetched, decomposing it
yields a BARE pole (no `dominant_step` / `steps`) that renders "no captured log" + "NO
CATALOG PATTERN MATCHED" — directly contradicting the report's own triage coverage note
(seen on alwaysmeticulous/report-diffs-action, `test-meticulous-upload-container.yaml`).

Two layers, both pinned here:
  - ENGINE: `collect_runs._structural_pole_candidates` drops a triaged workflow's check
    from the decomposed pole set (it stays on the `checks` spine, never a drilled pole).
  - INVARIANT (class guard): `verify_report.check_speed_poles_complete` re-derives the
    contradiction from the findings JSON (a triaged `workflow_file` appearing in
    `pr_critical_path.poles`) and FAILS, so any future repo that regrows the bug is caught.
